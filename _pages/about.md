Ph.D. candidate in communication studies with interests in philosophy, digital politics, game narratives and abstract and meaningless culture. Occasionally profound, often maddening. Hard to be succinct. My WeChat Subscription Account “shuying160310” [subreddit](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/SmVC5WugakJYlmcH7KyQKw)). 

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
